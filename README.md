What is Imgur
=============
from [http://imgur.com/faq#what](http://imgur.com/faq#what).

Imgur makes sharing images with the Internet easy. It can be used to share pictures with friends, as well as post images on message boards and blogs. You can manipulate the image a number of ways and automatically submit it to popular sites such as reddit or digg. You can also view popular user-submitted images in the gallery. Best of all, Imgur is completely free.

Why  HTML5/CSS3
===============
This app is deployed to Android and coming soon to iOS. It also works on WP7, BlackBerry and other platforms that support HTML5 and CSS4.

The UI is made in jQuery Mobile for compatability.
